# 🎬 MovieMeld

MovieMeld is a fun and simple web app built with Streamlit that helps two users discover movies they’re both likely to enjoy. Based on shared preferences like genre, runtime, reviews, and release era, the app returns a short list of movie suggestions—complete with posters, overviews, and key details.
